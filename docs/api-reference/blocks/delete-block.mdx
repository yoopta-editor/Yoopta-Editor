## Overview

The `deleteBlock` method removes a block from the editor and optionally focuses another block after deletion.

## Signature

```typescript
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor: YooEditor, options?: DeleteBlockOptions): void
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="editor" type="YooEditor" required>
  The editor instance
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options" type="DeleteBlockOptions">
  Configuration object for deleting the block

  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField path="at" type="number">
      Position of the block to delete. If not provided, uses `editor.path.current`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="blockId" type="string">
      ID of the block to delete. Takes precedence over `at` if both are provided.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="focus" type="boolean" default="true">
      Whether to focus a block after deletion
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="focusTarget" type="'previous' | 'next' | 'none'" default="'previous'">
      Which block to focus after deletion:
      - `'previous'` - Focus the previous block (default)
      - `'next'` - Focus the next block
      - `'none'` - Don't focus anything
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Blocks } from '@yoopta/editor';

// Delete current block
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor);

// Delete specific block by path
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, { at: 3 });

// Delete specific block by ID
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, { blockId: 'block-123' });
```

### Delete Without Focusing

```typescript
// Delete block without focusing another block
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, {
  at: 3,
  focus: false,
});
```

### Delete and Focus Next Block

```typescript
// Delete current block and focus the next one
Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, {
  focusTarget: 'next',
});
```

### Delete Multiple Blocks

```typescript
const deleteMultipleBlocks = (editor: YooEditor, blockIds: string[]) => {
  blockIds.forEach((blockId) => {
    Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, {
      blockId,
      focus: false, // Don't focus during batch deletion
    });
  });
};
```

## Use Cases

### Delete Current Block

```typescript
const deleteCurrentBlock = (editor: YooEditor) => {
  Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, {
    at: editor.path.current,
    focusTarget: 'previous',
  });
};
```

### Delete Block with Validation

```typescript
const safeDeleteBlock = (editor: YooEditor, blockId: string) => {
  const block = Blocks.getBlock(editor, { id: blockId });
  
  if (!block) {
    console.warn('Block not found');
    return;
  }

  // Check if it's safe to delete (e.g., not the only block)
  const allBlocks = Object.values(editor.children);
  if (allBlocks.length <= 1) {
    console.warn('Cannot delete the last block');
    return;
  }

  Blocks.deleteBlock(editor, { blockId });
};
```

## Notes

<Note>
  The method automatically calls the plugin's `onDestroy` lifecycle hook before deletion, allowing plugins to clean up resources.
</Note>

<Note>
  If the block doesn't exist (invalid `at` or `blockId`), the method will silently return without error.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Deleting a block is a destructive operation. There's no built-in undo mechanism, so consider implementing your own undo/redo system if needed.
</Warning>

<Info>
  When `focusTarget` is `'previous'` or `'next'`, the method will focus the target block at its last node point, allowing the user to continue editing seamlessly.
</Info>

## Type Definition

```typescript
type DeleteBlockOptions = {
  at?: number; // YooptaPathIndex
  blockId?: string;
  focus?: boolean;
  focusTarget?: 'previous' | 'next' | 'none';
};
```
